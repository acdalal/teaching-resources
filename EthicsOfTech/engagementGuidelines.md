# Engagement guidelines

(Curated in part from MIT’s teaching + learning lab)

1. Listen actively and with an ear to understanding others’ views.
2. Criticize ideas, not individuals. 
3. Recognize that agreement is not always necessary
4. Avoid blame, speculation, and inflammatory language.
5. Allow everyone the chance to speak: make space and take space.
6. Assume positive intent and take responsibility for impact.
