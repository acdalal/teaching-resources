# [wk4d2] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Explain how college rankings models impact the success of higher education institutions and shape the college application process.

- Give examples of proxy data used by college rankings models and policing models.

- Give examples of how proxy data can be gamed to influence the outcome of a model.

- Describe the impact of scale on a model.


## Readings 

Read the following chapters in _Weapons of Math Destruction_:

- Chapter 3, "Arms Race: Going to College"

- Chapter 5, "Civilian Casualties: Justice in the Age of Big Data"

Also read ["From the President's Desk: Reflections on College Rankings"](https://www.carleton.edu/president/news/from-the-presidents-desk-changes-in-college-rankings/), from the September 28, 2023 edition of _[Carleton Today](https://www.carleton.edu/today/carleton-today-september-28-2023/)_


## Guiding questions

1. What proxy data does the _US News and World Report_ model described in Chapter 3 use? How does that differ from the proxy data the model currently uses (according to President Byerly's remarks)? 

2. What are the key similarities between President Byerly's remarks on the updated USNWR college rankings model and the remarks of other college presidents in Chapter 3?

3. On page 55, O'Neil states that "when you create a model from proxies, it is far simpler for people to game it." Give an example (not from the chapter) of how manipulating a proxy changes the outcomes of a model.

4. What problems does scale pose to models?

5. List similarities and differences between the proxy data and objectives used by recidivism models like LSI-R and predictive policing models like PredPol.

6. List similarities and differences between the feedback loops of recidivism models like LSI-R and predictive policing models like PredPol.

7. Explain how our definition of what constitutes "crime" is a form of proxy data.

8. What might a predictive policing model that focused on fairness over efficiency (as opposed to current models that focus on efficiency over fairness) look like?
