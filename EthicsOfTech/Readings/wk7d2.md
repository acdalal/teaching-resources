# [wk7d2] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Reason about the ways in which technology and automation both reflect and reproduce structural racism.

- Reason about the social bias and social control aspects of technology, as they relate to race (and other aspects of identity).

## Readings 

Read Chapter 1, "Engineered Inequity", in _Race After Technology_.


## Guiding questions

1. Define the following terms in your own words:

    -  Deep learning
    -  Supervised machine learning
    -  Unsupervised machine learning
    -  Uncanny valley
    -  Robot
    -  Digital character
    
2. List a couple of examples of "digital castes" from the reading.

3. On page 76, Benjamin states, "Ultimately the danger of the New Jim Code positioning is that existing social biases are reinforced -- yes. But new methods of social control are produced as well." Give two examples that illustrate this point.

4. Earlier in the term we discussed sources of bias in algorithms. List three specific examples of algorithmic bias that are discussed in this chapter.

5. List two ways in which Benjamin draws parallels between robots and structural racism.
