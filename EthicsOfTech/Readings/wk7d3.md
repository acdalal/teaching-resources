# [wk7d3] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Understand how technical glitches also serve to reproduce societal bias and structural racism.

- Reason about the interplay between algorithm design and implementation, and underlying social structure.

## Readings 

Read Chapter 2, "Default Discrimination", in _Race After Technology_.


## Guiding questions

1. Give an example of a social code and an example of a legal code.

2. A recurring theme in this chapter is that glitches are "signal[s] of how the system operates." (Benjamin, pg. 80) Give two real-world examples of this theme.

3. On page 83, Benjamin states that "crime prediction algorithms should more accurately be called crime _production_ algorithms." Explain in your own words what this means, and provide an example.

4. _Weapons of Math Destruction_ and this chapter both discuss predictive policing and recidivism algorithms. In what ways do their discussions of these algorithms differ?

5. Give an example of hostile technical "architecture".
