# [wk2d1] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Define what care ethics or Ethics of Care (EoC) is and how it compares / contrasts with last week's ethical frameworks

- Gain exposure to two different types of EoC (feminist and Ubuntu)

- Gain a broad sense of what Buddhist ethics is


## Readings

- [The Ethics of Care and Feminism](https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/integrity-ethics/module-9/key-issues/ethics-of-care.html), from the UNDOC's Education for Justice campaign.

- [The African Ethic of Ubuntu](https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2019/09/08/the-african-ethic-of-ubuntu/), by Thaddeus Metz.

- (Not required, but if you want to dig deeper into the differences between EoC and African ethics, [The western ethic of care or an Afro-communitarian ethic? Specifying the right relational morality](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449626.2012.756421) by Thaddeus Metz is excellent.)

- [Buddhist Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_ethics) Wikipedia entry. You only have to read up to Issues. (The article goes into much more detail than we will; read so that you get the higher level concepts and don't worry about the details.)

<!-- - [What can AI learn from non-Western philosophies?](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-02-16/what-can-ai-learn-non-western-philosophies). Story from "The World", February 16, 2018. You can listen to the story (link is on that page) and/or read the [transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDIZYLdyGi766uJX3KSmkEGZnOqM55UY21HBaan-j4w/edit). -->

1. Define Ethics of Care in your own words.

2. What are the main components of an Ethics of Care? What are its main guiding principles?

3. Is EoC a teleological or a deontological ethics framework? Explain your answer.

6. What are the five precepts of Buddhism and how do they relate to ethics?

7. "Karma" is a term that is used a lot in everyday conversation. What is the actual meaning of karma, from a Buddhist ethical perspective?
