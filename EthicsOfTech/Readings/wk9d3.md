# [wk9d3] Peer review assignment

**Please carefully note the due dates for the various pieces of this assignment!**

We'll be conducting a peer review session in Friday's class. An important part of the writing process involves soliciting feedback from others and responding to this feedback through revision, and those are the skills we'll be practicing in the peer review. 

##  Peer review preparation

- If you have not done so already, put together a draft of your final project.
    - Different people will likely be in very different places with their drafts right now. That's fine. Whether you have a few paragraphs and some bullet points, a storyboard, or a full-fledged rough draft, it's all good.

    - Make a **PDF** version of your draft, however it exists. 

- Define **one specific question** you'd like your classmates to attempt to answer about your writing. This is not the *only* feedback your classmates will provide (I'll have a form for other questions), but it will ensure that what you consider to be the most important question about your writing for this assignment will be addressed. Include this question at the top of your draft.

- Send your draft to your peer review group members **by 5pm on Thursday, November 9**. I will set up channels on Slack for each of the peer review groups -- you can upload your draft there.

- Read, and take notes on, each of your group members' drafts. Use [this peer review form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12lCHkvxchHJdD-LcP9_FNHbuFDdllc74MNkDsBQYFu8/edit?usp=sharing). Note that you will need to make your own copy of this form for each of the students you're reviewing.

- Bring your notes / forms to class on **Friday, November 10** and be ready to discuss the strengths and areas for improvement for each person's draft in your group.
