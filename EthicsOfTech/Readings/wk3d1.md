## Readings

## Guiding questions

1. Based on your knowledge coming into this class, and the reading / listening material for today, how would you define "privacy"? What aspects of privacy do today's materials address? 

2. As you read / listen, jot down any unfamiliar terms. See if you can define those in your own words. (Feel free to look up the ones you can't define.) *Note: We will use these word lists as a starting point in our discussion in class on Monday, and work to define them together, so it's ok if you don't get the definitions exactly right.*

3. List a few mechanisms and strategies that websites and apps use to gather information about you.

4. Give 2 examples of how names encode information about us, according to Ruha Benjamin.

5. What is "the New Jim Code"?

6. Benjamin says on page 12 that "we should consider how private industry choices are in fact public policy decisions." Give an example of this.

7. Define "coded inequity" in your own words, and give an example.

8. Define "techno-determinism" in your own words, and give an example.

## Reading activity

What was one thing you heard or read that surprised you? This could be something you didn't know before, or something that made you think about your data differently, or something you found fascinating. Summarize this in 2-3 sentences in the thread I've started in the #readings channel on Slack.
