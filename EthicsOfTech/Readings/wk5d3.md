# [wk5d3] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

Understand the complexity and ethical issues surrounding facial recognition technology.

## Readings / videos

- [TED Talk: How I'm Fighting Bias in Algorithms](https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms?language=en), Joy Buolamwini

- ["Wrongly Accused by an Algorithm"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html), Kashmir Hill in the *NY Times*, June 24, 2020.

## Guiding questions

- As you watch the TED Talk and read or listen to the news story, see if you can identify the following. Note that "the algorithm" refers to any of the facial recognition examples in the reading / TED Talk.

    - Examples of inputs that influence the algorithm's outcome in expected ways

    - Examples of inputs that influence the algorithm's outcome

    - Aspects of the algorithm that are theoretically "neutral"

- To what extent, in your knowledge so far, are outcomes of facial recognition algorithms determined by the following:

    - The dataset on which the algorithm was trained
   
    - The image quality of the training data

    - The image quality of the actual data

    - The decisions made by the developers when writing and implementing the algorithm
