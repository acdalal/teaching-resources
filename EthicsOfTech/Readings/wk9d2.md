# [wk9d2] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Understand the scope and various aspects of the issue of (physical) electronic waste (e-waste).

- Connect the issues of e-waste and its impacts to broader themes from the course and from _Race After Technology_ (racism, colonialism, etc.)

## Readings

Aubrey Adams, Ann Beimers, Emmy Belloni, Tony Qiang. (2023) "Demystifying Electronic Waste: Exploring Tangible Harms and Solutions." CS 400: Electronic Waste Comps, final report, March 15, 2023. (PDF linked below)


## Guiding questions

1. Define e-waste in your own words.

2. What similar themes do you see in the case studies of Agbogbloshie and Guiya? How have these locations dealt with e-waste similarly? What effects are similar in both locations?

3. What connections can you draw between the discussion of communities impacted by e-waste and the themes of techno-racism in _Race After Technology_?

4. Define "slow violence" in your own words. 

5. What role does the paper claim the media plays in the e-waste problem?

6. Summarize how Free Geek addresses the issue of e-waste locally.

7. Summarize how Carleton addresses the issue of e-waste locally.

8. What is a right-to-repair law?

9. Unlike everything else we've read this term, this article was written by Carleton students (senior CS majors). What stylistic choices have these students made? How do they use evidence to persuade and inform the reader? If you could give them one piece of feedback to improve the article, what would it be?
