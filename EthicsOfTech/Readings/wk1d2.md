## Readings

- ["12 Things Everyone Should Understand About Tech"](https://medium.com/humane-tech/12-things-everyone-should-understand-about-tech-d158f5a26411), by Anil Dash. (2018)

- "Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change", a talk transcript from Neil Postman. (1998). (The PDF is attached at the bottom of this assignment page.)

## Guiding questions

As you read the two articles, consider the following questions. (You do not have to formally answer these, but it's helpful to answer them on your own / jot down some notes, and this will better prepare you for class. In fact, we may very well discuss one or more of these questions in class.)

1. Both of these articles outline things people "should" know about technology and its effects on society. What similarities exist in the two authors' points? Where do the two authors differ?

2. From what point of view is each author writing / speaking? What cues from the article did you use to discern this?

3. Neil Postman's fourth idea is that "Technological change is not additive; it is ecological." Thinking back to the exercise we did on the first day of class, how, if at all, did this point come up in your group's discussion?

4. Which of the authors' points resonated most with you? Which, if any, failed to resonate at all? Which points would you most disagree with, if any?

## Reading activity

Pick one of Anil Dash's 12 points. What example immediately sprung to mind illustrating that point? Post a few sentences in the #readings channel on Slack, in the thread that I've started. Do this by 10pm CT Thursday, September 16.
