A. Robertson (2018). [OLPC's $100 Laptop Was Going to Change the World -- Then It All Went Wrong.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now) *The Verge*, April 16, 2018.

(Note: If you're interested in reading more about this project, and about the issues with "tech for good", I recommend the book [*The Charisma Machine: The Life, Death, and Legacy of One Laptop Per Child*, by Morgan G. Ames (2019).](https://morganya.org/charisma.html))

3. What themes did you notice in this article that have been present in the conversations we've had about technology ethics this term?

4. Read [this definition of solutionism.](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/buzzword/entries/solutionism.html) In what ways does the OLPC project embody solutionism? Would you classify OLPC as solutionist?
