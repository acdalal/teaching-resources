# [wk9d1] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

Understand the environmental impacts of technology -- specifically, the carbon and water footprints of large-scale computing.

## Readings

Li, P., Yang, J., Islam, M. A., and Ren, S., “Making AI Less "Thirsty": Uncovering and Addressing the Secret Water Footprint of AI Models”, <em>arXiv e-prints</em>, 2023. doi:10.48550/arXiv.2304.03271. The PDF is linked below. 

You can skim the math in Section 3 and I don't expect you to have a deep understanding of all of the concepts in the article. I want you to read the article to get a base-level understanding of how much water (and electricity) models like ChatGPT use. 

## Guiding questions

1. What is the difference between "training" and "inference"? How is this difference reflected in the water usage for each task?

2. Summarize what the last column in Table 1 illustrates, in your own words.

3. What are some of the comparisons or analogies the authors make to describe the water usage? Which ones did you find helpful, and which ones did you find less helpful?

## Reading activity

Post a question, comment, or observation about the reading in the thread I've started in the #readings channel on Slack.
