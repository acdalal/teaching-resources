# [wk7d1] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Prepare you to reflect on your own writing process, particularly the things that hold you back.

- Prepare you to helpfully critique your classmates' writing in peer review.

## Reading

- Excerpt from *Write No Matter What: Advice for Academics*, by Joli Jensen. (The PDF is linked below)

- ["Guidelines for Students: Peer Review"](https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/peerreview/tips.html), from SERC at Carleton.

- The essay excerpts from the students in your peer review group (see below)


## Peer review preparation

We'll be conducting a mini peer review session in Friday's class. An important part of the writing process involves soliciting feedback from others and responding to this feedback through revision, and those are the skills we'll be practicing in Friday's peer review. This mini review will also prepare you for a longer peer review activity later in the term.

**Before class**, please complete the following:

- Select an excerpt of your Algorithmic Bias Essay draft that's about a page to a page and a half long. The excerpt should be something that you'd like feedback on -- for instance, something that's tripping you up or that you're finding hard to write, something you're less sure about, something that doesn't seem to flow well, etc.

- Define **one specific question** you'd like your classmates to attempt to answer about your writing. This is not the *only* feedback your classmates will provide (I'll have a form for other questions), but it will ensure that what you consider to be the most important question about your writing for this assignment will be addressed.

- Send your excerpt and your question to your group members. I've set up channels on Slack for each of the peer review groups -- you can upload your draft and post your question there. **Please post your draft as a PDF.**

- Read, and take notes on, each of your group members' drafts. Use the "Guidelines for Students -- Peer Review" as a guide for your note taking. Make sure you attempt to answer your group members' questions.

- Bring your notes to class!

- In addition to reading and jotting down notes, please reflect on the following questions related to the Jensen excerpt. 

    -  Which of these myths do you think you’re particularly susceptible to?  If you don’t particularly identify with any of Jensen’s myths, are there other distractions or justifications that you use to keep yourself from writing?

    - Why do you think this is the case?  Are there insecurities or aspects of the writing process that you’re trying to avoid with these behaviors, or are you just uncertain how to avoid them? 

    - What do you generally do to get past these behaviors and start writing productively?  Is this an effective or productive strategy?  If not, what else could you do?
