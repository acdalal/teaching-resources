# [wk2d1] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Prepare you for the A&I Convocation today.

- Provide you the opportunity to reflect on why you chose Carleton for your studies.

Note: There is nothing to hand in for this reading assignment, but I expect you to have the reading completed by the time class starts on Friday.
 

## Readings

["Only Connect: The Goals of a Liberal Education"](http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=hlh&AN=1273798&site=ehost-live), by William Cronon.

**Note:** 

[This page](https://www.carleton.edu/doc/ai-seminars/liberal-arts/) contains short reflections by three Carleton faculty members on what a liberal arts education means. You may be interested in hearing some Carleton-specific perspectives, particularly in advance of Convo today.

## Guiding questions

As you read the article, consider the following questions. (You do not have to formally answer these, but it's helpful to answer them on your own / jot down some notes, and this will better prepare you for class. In fact, we may very well discuss one or more of these questions in class.)

1. Why does Cronon choose the phrase "only connect" as the recurring theme in this essay?

2. Which of Cronon's ten qualities resonates most with you, and why?

3. Which of Cronon's ten qualities, at this point in your college career, are you most interested in developing in your time at Carleton?

4. Are there any qualities of a liberally educated person that you think are missing? If so, what are they?

## Reading activity

There is nothing due before class today. Bring your ideas and notes to class.
