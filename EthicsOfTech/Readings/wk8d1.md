# [wk8d1] Reading assignment

## Reading goals

- Analyze the ways in which technology is used to reinforce white supremacy.

- Reason about the harms of colorblindness and the assumption of good intentions in the design, implementation, and use of algorithms.


## Readings

Read the following chapters in _Race After Technology_:

-  Chapter 3, "Coded Exposure". You only need to read up to (but not including) the section "Exposing Privacy" (page 124), although you are welcome to read the entire chapter if you'd like.

-  Chapter 4, "Technological Benevolence"

## Guiding questions

1. On page 99, Benjamin states that "images have been one of the primary weapons in reinforcing and opposing social oppression."  Provide 3 examples from the readings that serve as evidence for this claim.

2. Give an example of "scopic vulnerability". (p 101)

3. List 2-3 examples in technology that reflect "the default setting of Whiteness". (p 112) 

4. Define "the datafication of injustice" (p 116) in your own words.

5. Benjamin discusses technological benevolence sarcastically (and/or ironically) in Chapter 4. What does she really mean by the term "technological benevolence"?

6. Give an example (not from the readings) that illustrates Ed Finn's observation of the connection between the power we imbue algorithms with and magic. (p 141)

7. Why might a diversity of biases be preferable to automated bias?

8. Give an example of how "algorithmic neutrality reproduces algorithmically sustained discrimination." (p 143)

9. Define "technological redlining" in your own words, and provide an example from a PREVIOUS reading.

10. Chapter 4 continues the theme of exposure from Chapter 3. Pick an example from Chapter 4 and explain how it connects to the themes of over- and under- exposure from Chapter 3.

11. Give an example of a racial fix.
