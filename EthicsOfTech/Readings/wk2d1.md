## Readings

- [What is Ethics?](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/), from the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.

- An excerpt from Chapter 1, "The Internet and Ethical Values", in Richard A. Spinello's *Cyberethics: Morality and Law in Cyberspace* (6th edition). The PDF is linked below.  

- "Superhuman Ethics Class with the Avengers Prime". Chapter 1 from Mark D. White's *The Avengers and 
Philosophy: Earthâ€™s Mightiest Thinkers*, 2012. PDF linked below. (You don't need to know much about Marvel superheroes to be able to follow the argument in the Avengers article. I know very little about the Marvel universe! Pay attention instead to the overall character traits and themes.)

## Guiding questions

As you read the articles, consider the following questions. (You do not have to formally answer these, but it's helpful to answer them on your own / jot down some notes, and this will better prepare you for class. In fact, we may very well discuss one or more of these questions in class.)

1. According to the Markkula Center article, what are some systems / concepts that people equate ethics with? For each of these systems / concepts, list one reason the article gives to not equate ethics with this.

2. What, according to the Markkula Center articles, are the two parts of ethics?

3. Summarize the differences between teleological ethics and deontological ethics.

4. There are four main frameworks introduced in *Cyberethics*. Classify each framework as either teleological or deontological.

5. What other fictional characters come to your mind when thinking about different ethical frameworks? 


## Reading activity

Post a question, comment, or observation about any of the readings in the #readings channel, in the thread I've started on Slack. This could be a concept you don't understand, something you found interesting, or an attempt to classify the ethical framework followed by your favorite fictional character. Complete this by 10pm CT Thursday, September 14 to receive credit.
