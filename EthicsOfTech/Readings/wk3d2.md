- ["The Politics of 'Real Names'"](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/8/153809-the-politics-of-real-names/fulltext), by danah boyd in *Communications of the ACM* 55(8), August 2012.

- ["Do I Have the Right to Be Forgotten?"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7nl2dEmylY26zF56wvKm6l) So, Bob podcast (S1 Episode 7)


## Guiding questions

1. How is the "real names" issue a privacy issue?

2. Explain what boyd means by this statement: "Privacy is not about restricting information; it is about revealing appropriate information in a given context."

3. What are the connections between privacy and control? (You can draw on either, or both, articles to answer this question.)

4. How would you define "digital shaming"? Come up with an example not mentioned in the article.

5. Both articles address the idea of accountability. What's similar about how the two articles define accountability, and where do the two articles differ?

6. Interestingly, former chairperson of Google, Eric Schmidt, shows up in both articles. How can you -- or is it possible to -- reconcile Schmidt's stance on names in the two articles?
