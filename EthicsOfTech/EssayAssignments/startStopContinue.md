# Start, stop, continue

## Objective

Provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your time at Carleton so far, and in particular what's working well and what you can improve.

## Due date

Friday, September 29, 10pm CT, on Moodle (see below for how to turn this in).

## Introduction

You've now been at Carleton for three weeks! You've settled into your classes, met lots of new people, and maybe even handed in some major assignments. You've likely learned a lot about what's working well for you at Carleton -- and what's not working as well. In this informal essay, you'll reflect back on your time at Carleton so far and plan out what you'll keep doing and what adjustments you'll make over the rest of the term. 
 
## Your task

Reflect on your experiences at Carleton over the last few weeks, and consider how youâ€™ll apply the lessons you learned in that time to your routines and habits over the rest of Fall Term.

Respond to the following items with at least one meaty paragraph (roughly 75-150 words) each. Don't just include the answer -- provide some context or an example to explain your answer.

1. What will you _start_ doing in order to be successful this term?

2. What will you _stop_ doing in order to be successful this term?

3. What will you _continue_ doing in order to be successful this term?

## Evaluation

This assignment counts towards your **informal essay** grade in this course, and will be evaluated on the following scale:

- **Satisfies**: All of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay. The essay is written in paragraph(s) form (as opposed to, say, bullet points). The reader can follow and understand the writing.

- **Partially Satisfies**: One or more of the following are true:

      - Some of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay

      - The reader may struggle somewhat to follow and understand the writing

      - The essay contains more bullet points than sentences.

- **Incomplete**: The essay is not submitted, or does not address the prompts.

Note: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.
