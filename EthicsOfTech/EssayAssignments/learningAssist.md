# Learning Assists

An important part of working in a scholarly community is learning to identify the ways that other people contribute to your learning. 
Conversely, one of the great satisfactions of working in a scholarly community -- and, indeed, a way to build this community --  is the opportunity to contribute to other people’s learning. 

To these ends, I’m asking you to write a short “Learning Assist” at the end of each week, starting in Week 2 of the term. **Learning Assists are due by 10pm CT on Fridays, starting on September 24, with the last one due on November 19.**

In 2-3 sentences in the space at the bottom of this page, please identify a classmate who in some way contributed to your learning that week and explain how they did so.  You should identify your classmate by name.

I won’t share your Assist with the person in question (though you’re welcome—and encouraged—to tell them yourself how they contributed to your learning).  However, each week I will award a Moodle badge to every person who receives an Assist, so they will know at least one person in the class singled them out for their contribution.

## Possible Sources of Learning Assists:
Here are a few ways that someone might contribute to your learning in a given week:

- Explaining an assignment or course concept to you in a way that helps your understanding

- Asking a question in class that leads your instructor or someone else to clarify something you didn’t fully understand

- Making an argument or describing a personal experience that allows to see an issue from a new perspective

- Providing helpful feedback on your writing or coursework

- Contributing significantly to a course-related discussion that you found interesting or beneficial (even if you can’t point to a specific thing you learned from it)

- Making a mistake or misstatement that gives your instructor or your peers the opportunity to clarify some aspect of the course material

- Pointing out someone else’s mistake (including the instructor) in a way that leads to greater clarity or understanding

- Improving the overall atmosphere or comfort level of the course in some way

- Making you feel included and "heard" by acknowledging your contribution to a discussion.

This is not a comprehensive list, though.  If you can identify another way that a peer has helped you learn in a given week that doesn’t fit into one of the categories above, feel free to tell me about it.

## If You Can’t Think of a Assist

If you really try, I’m confident that you will be able to identify at least one way a peer has helped you learn in any given week.  However, if you’re absolutely stuck, here are a few other options.  *Please use these sparingly, though, if you use them at all:*

- Describe a way that one of your classmates contributed to someone else’s learning.  If, for example, someone in your discussion group went out of their way to encourage a shy classmate to contribute to the conversation, you might give that person an Assist.

- Describe a way you contributed to someone else’s learning in the previous week.

- Describe something significant you learned from a classmate in this course, even if it doesn’t directly relate to the course material.

- Describe something specific that occurred in the previous week that helped you to understand some aspect of the course material more clearly, even if a specific classmate didn’t contribute to that moment of clarity.

## Additional Notes

- Avoid backhanded compliments -- that is, “compliments” that actually criticize the person in question.  E.g. “My peer reviewer didn’t really give me any useful feedback, so I guess I learned how not to write a peer review.”

- Keep your audience in mind.  You should address your Assists to me, but ideally the peer you discuss will read it as well.

- Don’t overstate things.  A peer doesn’t have to blow your mind or completely change your understanding of something in order to earn an Assist.  They just have to do something that in one way or another helps you learn.

## Evaluation

You will receive "completion" credit if your Learning Assist is turned in within 24 hours of the due date (i.e. Friday at 10pm CT for that week).
