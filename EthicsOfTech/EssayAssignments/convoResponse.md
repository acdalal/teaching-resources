# A&I Convo Response

## Objective

Provide you with an opportunity to reflect on what you learned in the A&I Convocation given by Prof. Susan Jaret McKinstry on September 22, and how this relates to how you think about a liberal arts education.

**Unlike other informal writing assignments in this course, you will complete this assignment during class on Friday, and hand in your essay at the end of class.**

## Due date

Friday September 22, 1pm CT, on Moodle (see below for how to turn this in).
 
## Your task

**As a class**, write a response to the A&I Convo presentation by Dr. Susan Jaret McKinstry that you just heard. That is, you will work **together** to write **one** collaborative essay with your reactions to the A&I Convo. You will hand in this essay at the end of the class period today (Friday, September 22).

Here's how you should proceed:

1. Select 2 people to take notes, 1 person to keep track of time, and 1 person who will be the "essay typer". I've started a Google Doc [link] for your response. (Note takers can also use this Google Doc for their notes if they'd like.)

2. Spend about **15 minutes** discussing what you heard during the Convo, and answering the following questions. Bring in specific details and examples from the presentation wherever possible. The 2 note takers should take notes during the discussion.
 
    - What, in your estimation, are the ideal qualities of an A&I Convo presentation?  To put this question in a bit of context, the A&I convo is delivered every year in the second week, and while it is open to anyone from Carleton or the Northfield community, all first-term Carleton students are *required* to attend it.  So, if you think of yourself and your fellow first-term students as the primary audience, what general subjects do you think the A&I convo should address?  What overall tone or atmosphere should the speaker try to create? 

    - With your answers above in mind, how well do you believe Dr. Jaret McKinstry fulfilled the goals of the A&I convo?  What specific aspects of her address lead you to your conclusions?

    - How was Dr. Jaret McKinstry’s talk relevant to our A&I class?  She (probably) didn’t say anything specifically about tech ethics, but did she address anything that connected to the reading or writing skills we’ve discussed, or to our examination of scholarship and academic writing?

    - What point or claim of Dr. Jaret McKinstry’s was most interesting to you and why?

    - If next year’s A&I convo speaker asked you for help preparing their speech, what advice would you give them?  As an A&I student, what do you want (and not want) from the convo that’s designed specifically for first-term freshmen?  Don’t just say something obvious and superficial like “keep it short”; really think about what a speaker could say or do that would really connect with you as a first-term student here.
    
3. At the end of the discussion (the timekeeper will stop discussion after 15 minutes), the 2 note takers should summarize what they heard and wrote down, to make sure they captured the main points of the discussion appropriately. This shouldn't take any longer than 5 minutes (the timekeeper should watch the time here too).

4. Spend the remainder of class time turning your discussion notes into an essay. How you choose to do this is up to you. You may decide to divide into smaller groups and have each small group write a paragraph answering one of the questions. You may decide to write the entire essay in one large group (with the essay typist entering suggestions from the rest of the group). **Leave 5 minutes at the end to re-read the essay as a group to make sure it flows and captures your ideas appropriately.**

5. Since your essay is a Google Doc, you don't have to physically submit anything. 

I will read your response before class on Monday September 25, and we will spend a bit of time at the start of class discussing your response.

## Helpful hints

If time is short, you can skip the last question (advice for the speaker), and we'll discuss it in the next class meeting. 

## Evaluation

This assignment counts towards your **informal essay** grade in this course, and will be evaluated on the following scale:

- **Finished**: All of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay. The essay is written in paragraph(s) form (as opposed to, say, bullet points). The reader can follow and understand the writing.

- **Pending**: One or more of the following are true:

      - Some of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay

      - The reader may struggle somewhat to follow and understand the writing

      - The essay contains more bullet points than sentences.

- **Incomplete**: The essay is not submitted, or does not address the prompts.

Note: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.
