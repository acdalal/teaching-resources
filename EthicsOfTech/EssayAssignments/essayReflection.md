# Privacy analysis essay reflection

## Objective

Provide you with an opportunity to reflect on your writing process for the first formal essay in the course, and consider what aspects of your process you will keep and modify on future assignments.

## Due date

Friday, October 13, 10pm CT, on Moodle (see below for how to turn this in).

## Introduction

Now that you’ve completed your first formal essay in the course, it’s time to think concretely about how to approach your next major assignment.  To do this, you’ll first look back on your process for writing the essay--what worked well for you and what didn’t. Then, you'll take what you learned from the last assignment and use it to create an overall plan for writing your second formal essay in this course.
 
## Your task

Reflect on the process of writing your first major essay in this class, and consider how you’ll apply the lessons you learned in that process to your next major assignment in this course.

Respond to the following items with at least one meaty paragraph (roughly 75-150 words) each:

1. How well did you predict your writing process?  Did you have enough time to complete each step of the assignment to your satisfaction?

2. What feedback did you receive during the writing process (e.g. peer review, notes from the Writing Associate, advice from your instructor), and how useful was it to you?  Do you expect to change the way you receive and use feedback on the next essay, and if so, how?

3. What surprised you about the process of writing and revising this assignment?

4. Moving forward, what practices did you use on this assignment that you plan to use again on future writing assignments?  What practices do you plan to change?


## Helpful hints

Please submit this essay as a PDF (preferred) or as a Word document (.docx format). **Please do not put your name on your essay or in the filename!** I grade "blindly" and would prefer not to have identifying information on your submission.
 
Your essay should be double-spaced.

## Evaluation

This assignment counts towards your **informal essay** grade in this course, and will be evaluated on the following scale:

- **Satisfies**: All of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay. The essay is written in paragraph(s) form (as opposed to, say, bullet points). The reader can follow and understand the writing.

- **Partially Satisfies**: One or more of the following are true:

      - Some of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay

      - The reader may struggle somewhat to follow and understand the writing

      - The essay contains more bullet points than sentences.

- **Incomplete**: The essay is not submitted, or does not address the prompts.

Note: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.
