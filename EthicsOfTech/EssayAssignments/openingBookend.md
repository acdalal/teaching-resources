# Opening Bookend Assignment

## Objective

Different experiences in your life, most recently the college application and selection process, have shaped your understanding of what you will experience in college, what you’re expected to accomplish, what college will be like for you, and what you will be like in college.  You probably already know that not all of your expectations will be accurate.  Every student approaches college differently, and thus every college experience is unique.  

**This assignment is designed to help you articulate what you expect from your college experience and how various experiences in your personal history have influenced those expectations.** Beyond that, though, it will also ask you to consider who you will be as a college student: how you’ll learn, what challenges you might face, and what strengths and assets you’re bringing to college that will help you succeed.

## Due date

Tuesday, September 21, 10pm CT, on Moodle (see below for how to turn this in).
 
## Your task

In roughly 500-750 words (about 1.5-2 double-spaced pages of type) describe what you anticipate for yourself in the coming year: 
 
- Given your expectations, how do you see yourself engaging in college? What personal skills, experiences, and resources do you bring with you, and how do you imagine these might emerge as assets for you in college?
 
- What do you anticipate writing, speaking, reading and listening will be like at the college level? How do you imagine you’ll learn to navigate these activities?
 
- Do you anticipate any challenges, and, if so, what are they and how do you expect you might deal with them?

## Helpful hints

Please submit this essay as a PDF (preferred) or as a Word document (.docx format). **Please do not put your name on your essay or in the filename!** I grade "blindly" and would prefer not to have identifying information on your submission.
 
Keep in mind that this is not an admissions essay! You’ve been accepted, and I’m glad you’re here! This is more of a time capsule, an honest index of who you are and where you are now at the beginning of your college career. You’ll write a response to this assignment at the end of the semester, so imagine you’re writing with your future self as your audience.

## Evaluation

This assignment counts towards your **informal essay** grade in this course, and will be evaluated on the following scale:

- **Finished**: All of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay. The essay is written in paragraph(s) form (as opposed to, say, bullet points). The reader can follow and understand the writing.

- **Pending**: One or more of the following are true:

      - Some of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay

      - The reader may struggle somewhat to follow and understand the writing

      - The essay contains more bullet points than sentences.

- **Incomplete**: The essay is not submitted, or does not address the prompts.

Note: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.
