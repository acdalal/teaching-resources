# [formal writing] Final project

## Objectives

Apply and synthesize your learnings from this course by exploring an ethical topic of your choice.

## Due date

Monday, 20 November 2023, 9:30pm CT. **Note that this is a FIRM deadline -- there is NO grace period for this assignment, per Carleton policy.**
 
## Your task

For your final project, you will present a piece educating your readers on the ethical issues of the topic of your choice. You may choose to do a deeper dive into a subject we've explored (or will explore) this term, or choose a topic we have not covered that falls under the (broad) umbrella of "ethical technology". See the "Prewriting" section below for some ideas.

Unlike previous formal writing assignments in this course, you have several options for the format of your project. You may choose to do:

- a 5-6 page formal essay

- a persuasive op-ed (1000-1500 words)

- a 5 minute video presentation with appropriate visuals

- an infographic (accompanied by a brief "about this infographic" article)

- something else not represented here (run your idea by Amy first!)

### Topic ideas

- Medical technologies / digital medical records / health care. This is a really rich area for exploration, and there are many different angles you could pursue.

- Ecological impacts of technology, whether that's the energy consumption of data centers or cryptocurrency mining, e-waste, etc.

- "Tech saviorism". There are many ways in which technology has been developed to "solve" some globally challenging problem -- the One Laptop Per Child program is a great example of this. Often times, this development occurs without the input or participation of affected groups.

- Corporate ethics. 

- Electronic voting.

- "White hat" hacking, or trying to break systems as a way of finding flaws that companies can then fix. 

- Legal approaches to tech ethics.

- Anonymity / pseudonymity / "catfishing", and the myriad ways people define their identities online.

- Social services algorithms and systems that we did not explicitly discuss in class.

- Social media platforms. In this case, you'd probably want to pick one platform and do a deep dive into that platform.

### Write up

The goal of your piece is to educate your audience about your topic, including some background about the technical parts and a presentation of the key ethical issues or arguments surrounding the topic. Your broad goals are to answer the questions "what is this issue and why should you care?" for your audience.

#### Background technical information

This section should provide the reader enough information about the topic so that they can understand the ethical issues you are about to present. Assume your reader has heard of your topic in passing but is otherwise unfamiliar with it. 

For example, let's suppose my topic is tech corporations and I'm specifically looking at GitHub. GitHub does a lot of good for the community -- providing free code repositories and educational tools -- but it also sells its services to the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In this section, I'd start out by explaining what GitHub is and what they do. I'd also explain what a code repository is, who uses code repositories, and how code repositories are vital to the workflow of lots of different types of people (with examples!). I'd end this section by talking about the services that GitHub provides, delineating which ones are paid services and which ones are free services, and talk a bit about how they discount or provide free services to certain sectors, such as education and open-source software.

If I was writing a formal essay, this part would probably run me about 2 pages. Depending on your topic, this section might be slightly shorter for you.

#### Description of ethical issues

The majority of your piece should concentrate on the ethical issues wrapped up in your topic. You should cover the following areas in this section:

- The affected constituents, and how they are affected.

- Places where the effects on constituents are in conflict with each other. (In other words, what things are positives for one group but negatives for another?)

- Places where the effects on constituents are uniform. (In other words, how are different groups similarly affected by your topic?)

- How to weigh the benefits and harms against each other, viewed through an ethical lens. Here is where you'd bring in ethical frameworks and discuss how they apply to the situation.

- End with the key takeaway points. What are the most important points you want your reader to take away from this piece, that will help them more ethically interact with whatever your topic is?

Let's go back to my GitHub example. In this part of the essay, I'd describe the many benefits to educators and to open source software developers that result from having access to some of  GitHub's paid services for free. I'd probably bring in my personal experience as an educator who uses GitHub's services in my courses and for my own research and teaching work, and how beneficial these services have been to me and to my students. I'd explain, too, the conundrum that employers expect students to have strong GitHub skills (i.e. it's a pseudo-monopoly). I'd then delve into how ICE uses GitHub services and products to facilitate bringing harm to others, and bring in some details on what GitHub says about this in response. I'd spend a good bit of time talking about utilitarianism and its limits, altruism and its limits, and a bit about contractarianism, as my ethical frameworks. I would bring in examples of alternate ways to accomplish the same tasks, and talk a bit about their limits. Finally, I'd end with a list of questions that those considering using a code repository through GitHub should ask themselves so that they can make a more informed ethical decision.

## Helpful hints

- Note that even if you choose a medium other than a formal essay, **there is a fair amount of writing involved in this assignment.** If you're doing a video presentation, you'll need to write several drafts of a script. If you're doing an infographic, you will need to create several drafts of an outline of concepts / storyboard, as well as drafts of the infographic's description. In other words, you'll still be writing and revising drafts along the way, although the "writing" part may look different from what you've done previously in this course.

- Please use [APA style citations](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/c.php?g=146832&p=7520832). You should include a citation if you use an idea from one of the class readings or if you're directly quoting something from a website (for instance, a site's privacy policies). You should, of course, also cite the sources you used that describe the algorithm and scenario / issue.

- To the extent possible, do not include identifying information in your submission. (Admittedly, this is difficult to impossible if you are submitting a video!) If you *can* refrain from identifying yourself in your chosen medium then do so, but if it's not possible (as with video) then don't worry about it.

## Evaluation

This project counts towards your Formal Writing grade in this course, and will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- **Structure and flow**: This includes the overall organization of the piece and how easy it is to read and/or follow along.

- **Appropriate use of the medium**: Have you utilized your chosen medium effectively to get your points across? Could this have worked better in a different medium?

- **Integration of evidence and sources**: How did you use your identified sources in your piece? Do your sources, and the evidence you choose to include, enhance your points?

- **Background information**: How clearly are you able to outline the scenario, issue, or topic? How easily would your reader be able to explain the topic to others in their own words?

- **Ethical discussion and presentation**: How well are you able to convey your ethical analysis? Does your analysis indicate a solid understanding of the underlying ethical framework(s)? How well can you articulate arguments for and against? 

Please see the rubric for more detailed information.

Your piece will receive an overall grade of Exemplary / Proficient / Developing / Not Assessable. 

You may NOT revise this piece.
