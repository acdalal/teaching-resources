# [informal writing] Final project proposal

## Objectives

- Apply and synthesize your learnings from this course by exploring an ethical topic of your choice.

- Plan out how to best present your topic of interest in the final project.

## Due date

Thursday, November 4, 10pm on Moodle.
 
## Your task

For your final project, you will present a piece educating your readers on the ethical issues of the topic of your choice. You may choose to do a deeper dive into a subject we've explored (or will explore) this term, or choose a topic we have not covered that falls under the (broad) umbrella of "ethical technology". See the "Prewriting" section below for some ideas.

Unlike previous formal writing assignments in this course, you have several options for the format of your project. You may choose to do:

- a 5-6 page formal essay

- a persuasive op-ed (1000-1500 words)

- a 5 minute video presentation with appropriate visuals

- an infographic (accompanied by a brief "about this infographic" article)

- something else not represented here (run your idea by Amy first!)

This proposal is your opportunity to plan out your final project -- the topic and the format -- and to communicate this information to me.

Your proposal should contain the following information (written as paragraphs or predominantly as paragraphs):

- Your selected topic and specific area of focus. For example, if your topic is "social media", you should focus on one platform, like TikTok.

- The key ethical issues (to the extent you can articulate them) that your project will explore. 

- The format you plan to use, and a few sentences as to why you've chosen that particular format and why it works for the topic you've chosen.

- Bibliographic information for **at least** two sources that provide background information about the issue. Include this information in APA format and provide links where appropriate. Acceptable sources include:

    - news stories 
    - long-form journalism stories
    - blog posts on **reputable** blogs
    - books and book chapters
    - podcasts
    - TED Talks
    - academic articles

Your proposal should be about 1 single-spaced page.

## Helpful hints

- Note that even if you choose a medium other than a formal essay, **there is a fair amount of writing involved in this assignment.** If you're doing a video presentation, you'll need to write several drafts of a script. If you're doing an infographic, you will need to create several drafts of an outline of concepts / storyboard, as well as drafts of the infographic's description. In other words, you'll still be writing and revising drafts along the way, although the "writing" part may look different from what you've done previously in this course. Take this information into account when planning out your project.

- Please use [APA style citations](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/c.php?g=146832&p=7520832). You should include a citation if you use an idea from one of the class readings or if you're directly quoting something from a website (for instance, a site's privacy policies). You should, of course, also cite the sources you used that describe the algorithm and scenario / issue.

- Feel free to bounce ideas off of each other, Amy, and/or Grace, no matter how much or little you've thought them out. In particular, Amy would love to sit down with you and help you figure out the best venue for a particular idea.


## Evaluation

This assignment counts towards your **informal essay** grade in this course, and will be evaluated on the following scale:

- **Finished**: All of the questions in the prompt are addressed in the essay. The essay is written in paragraph(s) form (as opposed to, say, all bullet points). The reader can follow and understand the writing.

- **Pending**: One or more of the following are true:

      - Some of the questions in the prompt are not addressed in the essay

      - The reader may struggle somewhat to follow and understand the writing

      - The essay contains more bullet points than sentences.

- **Incomplete**: The essay is not submitted, or does not address the prompts.

Note: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.

## Turning your assignment in
