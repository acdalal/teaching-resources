# Closing Bookend Assignment

## Objective

Congratulations on finishing your first term as a college student! As you reflect on your term, your time in this course, and your development as an intellectual, thinker, reader, writer, speaker, listener, and student, we would like you to revisit the questions we asked you at the beginning of the semester. 

First, you should look back over the reflective writing you've completed this term, particularly the first bookend essay.  Then, read and respond to the questions below.  What, if anything, has changed? What experiences this term led to those changes?  This kind of thinking and reflection can help you consolidate what youâ€™ve learned and lay the foundation for new knowledge and growth. 

It has been a pleasure working with you this term and, again, congratulations!

## Due date

Wednesday, November 15, 10pm, on Moodle.

**Note that this is a FIRM deadline -- there is NO grace period for this assignment, per Carleton policy.**
 
## Your task

In roughly 500-750 words (about 1.5-2 double-spaced pages of type) please address the following questions: 
 
- What personal skills, experiences, and resources were beneficial to you this term? Did these match the expectations you had for your college experience at the beginning of the term? Did any of them surprise you?
  
- Did you encounter any challenges this term? If so, how did you navigate them? Did any of these challenges surprise you? 

- What challenges do you anticipate in the terms ahead, and what strategies and skills will you use to navigate them?

## Helpful hints

Please submit this essay as a PDF (preferred) or as a Word document (.docx format). Remember to not include your name on or in your essay (or filename), so that I can grade anonymously!

Reminder: Informal essays are more like response or reflection writing. I'm not looking for a strong thesis statement or strong and specific evidence. I am more interested in what your thoughts are on a particular topic in the moment.
