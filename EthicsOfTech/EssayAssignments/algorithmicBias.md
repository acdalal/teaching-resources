# [formal writing] Algorithmic Bias

## Objectives

- Identify and analyze the sources of bias in algorithms

- Reason about the role of algorithms in societal decision-making processes, and their ethical implications

- Apply concepts from the course readings and discussions in formal writing


## Due date

Tuesday, October 24, 10pm CT, on Moodle (see below for how to turn this in).
 
## Your task

For this assignment, you will choose a current algorithm being used to make or supplement decisions related to some social, political, educational, cultural, etc. issue or scenario, and analyze the ethics of using that algorithm in that scenario. Read on for details.

### Pre-writing: Selecting an issue and an algorithm

Identify an issue or scenario of interest to you personally. This could be an issue or scenario we've explicitly discussed in class or included in the readings, in which case I'd expect you to choose a slightly different angle than what we covered in class. Or, it could be something from another realm.

Here are some examples you might consider:

- Education
    - Autograding and autograders
    - Plagiarism detection software
    - Admissions processes (for private high schools, colleges and universities, gifted and talented programs, majors, etc.)
    - Evaluating teacher effectiveness
    - Evaluating school performance

- Social services
    - Eligibility determination for social programs like WIC, EBT, Medicaid
    - Eligibility determination for housing for the unhoused
    - Sentencing / recidivism prediction tools

- Social media and entertainment
    - Facebook's News Feed / Instagram's feed
    - Predictive content services (Netflix recommendations, Pandora, etc.)

- Facial and image recognition -- there are many aspects you could explore here! Joy Buolamwini's TED Talk has some ideas for starting points.

I'm happy to brainstorm ideas with you as well. Feel free to discuss ideas with Grace and your classmates, too!

Once you've selected a focus area, identify the algorithm used in that area. In some cases, there are multiple algorithms, so pick one and focus on that. (For instance, there are several recidivism prediction tools; COMPAS is probably the most (in)famous of these, so you could select that one.)

Finally, identify **at least two sources** that discuss the algorithm and the issue. Acceptable sources include:

- news stories 
- long-form journalism stories
- blog posts on **reputable** blogs
- book chapters
- podcasts
- TED Talks

### Write up

Your essay will consist of three parts.

#### Part 1: Summarize the algorithm

This part of the essay should describe the algorithm and the scenario(s) in which it is used. You shouldn't do a technical deep dive here -- your essay should be written for a general audience. Your summary should address the following questions:

- Who developed this algorithm? (company, startup, an individual)

- What was the motivation behind the development of this algorithm? What problem(s) does it attempt to solve, and what's the approach?

- How long has this algorithm been in use?

- What does this algorithm use as input (both in making a specific decision in a specific instance, and as training data)?

- What prediction or outcome does the algorithm produce?

This part of the essay should be about a page single-spaced.

#### Part 2: Sources of bias

Select three likely sources of bias attached to this algorithm, and spend a paragraph or two on each of them. For each bias, identify

- What type of bias it is: data source bias, proxy data, proxy models, the world view of the developer or end user, cultural stereotypes, etc.

- The affected parties: end users, targets, etc. Remember that algorithms may have unintended consequences not foreseen by the developers or end users, and feel free to bring those in as appropriate.

- How the bias manifests itself in the outcomes or predictions the algorithm makes. For this part, you might find it helpful to distinguish between the expected / average outcomes and the outliers.

This section of the essay should be about 2-3 pages long, single-spaced.

#### Part 3: Ethical analysis

Select the ethical framework that **most closely** fits the decision to deploy the algorithm in your chosen scenario. (For example, you might say that hedonism is the ethical framework that best describes the Pandora music streaming service.)

- Describe how this ethical framework argues **for** using the algorithm in this situation.

- Provide at least one counterargument **against** using the algorithm in this situation. You can use the same ethical framework or choose a different framework to answer this part.

- Conclude by indicating which side you agree with more -- in other words, whether you believe more strongly in the ethical argument **for** the algorithm's use or for the argument **against** the algorithm's use in this scenario. Provide at least two pieces of evidence to back up your claim. Note that this can serve as the conclusion to your essay.

This section should be a page to a page and a half long, single-spaced.


## Helpful hints

- Your essay should have a clear introduction and a strong conclusion, as well as a title.

- If it helps you organize your thoughts, you can use section headings in your essay.

- Please use [APA style citations](https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/c.php?g=146832&p=7520832). You should include a citation if you use an idea from one of the class readings or if you're directly quoting something from a website (for instance, a site's privacy policies). You should, of course, also cite the sources you used that describe the algorithm and scenario / issue.

- Please do not include identifying information in your essay, your essay title, or your file name so that I can grade blindly.


## Evaluation

This essay counts towards your Formal Writing grade in this course, and will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- **Structure and flow**: This includes the overall organization of the essay and how easy it is to read and follow along.

- **Algorithm description**: This includes how clearly you describe and summarize the algorithm and the scenario to which it's applied.

- **Bias description**: How clearly and precisely are you able to identify, describe, and discuss the sources of bias and their repercussions? Have you identified the main sources of bias and the main affected parties?

- **Ethical arguments**: How well are you able to convey your ethical analysis? Does your analysis indicate a solid understanding of the underlying ethical framework(s)? How well can you articulate arguments for and against? How effectively do you integrate evidence?

Please see the rubric (coming soon) for more detailed information.

Your essay will receive an overall grade of Exemplary / Proficient / Developing / Not assessable. 

You may revise this essay.
