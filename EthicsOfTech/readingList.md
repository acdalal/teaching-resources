# Amy's ethics of technology reading list

Links go to the author's website or to [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/), an aggregate site for independent bookstores. I've also noted where Carleton's library owns a copy, and whether the copy is a physical book or a digital book.

- [*Unlocking the Clubhouse*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/unlocking-clubhouse) and [*Stuck in the Shallow End*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/stuck-shallow-end-updated-edition), Jane Margolis. These books are about how computer science is taught, at the college level (*Unlocking the Clubhouse*) and at the high school level (*Stuck in the Shallow End*). It focuses on questions of access and participation in computing, and how these patterns are set early on. Carleton has a physical copy of *Unlocking the Clubhouse* and a digital copy of the first edition of *Stuck in the Shallow End*.

In addition to the books above, the students in Casey Fiesler's Information Ethics and Policy class at the University of Colorado, Boulder maintain a [list of news articles on tech ethics and tech policy.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHgRYtNQ_VeMzycayrpfGs1UFjw_-gipMcdH-SFgnTo/edit?usp=sharing) I often reference this list when assigning ethics readings and to get a sense of the tech news landscape.

One final resource: [The Markup](https://themarkup.org) is an online news source covering the intersections of technology and society. The reporting is strong, and they publish the tools they use and create during their investigations.
