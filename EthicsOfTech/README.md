# CS 100: Ethics of Technology

This course is a first year seminar -- or, as Carleton calls them, an [Argument and Inquiry Seminar](https://www.carleton.edu/provost/ai-seminars/) (A&I for short). The purpose of the seminars as a whole is to "provide students with an understanding of the meaning and value of a liberal arts education during their first months at Carleton", by introducing students to "the ways that scholars ask questions, as well as find, use, and evaluate information effectively and ethically in constructing arguments." (Argument & Inquiry Seminar Resources, web page) A&I seminars are the first "writing-rich" course that students take at Carleton; all first-year students take an A&I seminar in Fall Term. 

The most current offering of this course was Fall 2023.

In this repo, you will find the following:

- The syllabus for the course
- "Guidelines for engagement" for in-class and Slack discussions and activities
- A weekly grid listing the topics covered each class day and the assignments due each week
- A "track your own progress" grading spreadsheet for students, because Moodle (our CMS) does not play nicely AT ALL with specifications grading.
- A list of other books and resources related to ethics and technology.
- All of the reading assignments, and some of the non-book / non-web readings I assigned (in PDF format)
- All of the essay assignments, both formal and informal, and some of the rubrics for the formal essays. (The rest of the rubrics will be added to the repo as I get them off of Moodle.)

Most of the materials are in Markdown format.
