# Team formation worksheet

The purpose of today's exercise is to help me place you into teams for the term-long database driven web project. You will identify others who share your criteria in several dimensions of team composition, and use this information to negotiate potential teams.

**DIRECTIONS**: Visit all of the stations (tables 1-7) during this class period. Each table contains a prompt related to each of the areas listed below. Jot down the names of at least 3 people who meet **your** criteria in that area (along with any notes you want to remember). 

At the end of the class period, I will give you 10 minutes to review your notes and jot down any other information that you think would help me place you on a team.

I will circulate to answer questions.
