# Team formation activity
_Day 7_

## Objectives
- Have students identify priorities in team composition
- Have students work to form teams that match these priorities

## Pre-class
Have students fill out and submit the team priority form.

## Class plan
- Handouts: project summary, worksheet, index cards
- Brief walkthrough of project
- Activity: table/stations priority setting
- Last 10-15 minutes: team formation exercise

## Activity: Priority setting
**Purpose**: Have students consider and state their own priorities in various areas of team composition, and identify students who match these priorities 

**Supplies**: Index cards, worksheets

**Time**: 30 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Explain the purpose of the activity
2. Point out that the stations on their sheets match up with index cards on tables.
3. Each index card lists a criterion and a set of guiding questions.
4. Students should visit each table, and identify other students in the class who match their priorities in each of the areas. They should list these students on their sheets in the correct category.
5. At the conclusion of the activity, students spend a few minutes independently reviewing their lists in each category, and write down anything else I should take into consideration when forming teams (that's not represented on the form they submitted before class or elsewhere on the sheet).

**Instructor role**:

- Note which tables tend to be visited first and last
- Note which tables students tend to spend the longest amount of time at
- Ensure students visit all tables
- Try to dissuade students from visiting tables in "packs" (branch out from their friend group)
- Jump-start conversations at tables where students look a bit lost.

**Debrief**:

- Have students optionally report out on the experience. Did their priorities change as a result of this exercise? How did, and does, their thinking about team composition match up (or not!) with the readings on team success?
- Note my observations about order of table visits, popular tables.
- Ask students to evaluate the stations I chose. What categories should I have included, but didn't? What categories should be left out in the future? (Note that student feedback is really valuable here -- I added "personal motivation" and "getting things done" because of student feedback!) 

## Post-class

Instructor uses the information on the sheets in conjunction with the form answers to put students into teams. Based on past experience, in case of ties or ambiguity, default to matching students based on time-of-day preference.
