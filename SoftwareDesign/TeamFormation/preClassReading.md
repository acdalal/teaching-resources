# Reading assignment: Effective teams

In class this week, we'll start our term-long project: developing a database-driven web application. In Monday's class, I'll introduce the project, and we'll form teams. 

## Readings
These two articles discuss a long-term study Google conducted on the characteristics of effective teams. Read one of them and skim the other (or, if you're feeling ambitious, go ahead and read both):
- Google's writeup on [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)
- From the New York Times Magazine: [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)


## On your own
As you read through these articles, consider your own experiences in working in teams or pairs.
- What were some _specific_ characteristics of the _most_ effective pair/team collaboration experiences?
- What were some _specific_ characteristics of the _least_ effective pair/team collaboration experiences?
- How do your experiences match with the characteristics of effective teams from the articles? How do they differ?


## To hand in

Before class, I'd like you to reflect on some of the factors that are important to  _you_ when working on a project team. Please fill out this (very brief!!) survey by 9am on Monday, January 20. The survey asks you to rank 6 factors in terms of their importance to you.
